# Kopernikus - Advanced Tracking Sequencer

[StarTracker](https://github.com/koepla/StarTracker) is the diploma thesis of Ilja Roman KÃ¶hler and Elias Engelbert
Plank. While the original desktop application
served its purpose, it is time for a rewrite.

## Features

Development on kopernikus is active, the following features are currently planned:

- Object browser
- Position graphs
- Use of [libsolaris](https://github.com/koepla/solaris)
- Sequencer (that shows a rendered section of the sky for each object)
- Properties
- ASCOM support
- Slewing curves

## Philosophy

Kopernikus follows the Handmade philosophy
