# Kopernikus - Advanced Tracking Sequencer

StarTracker is the diploma thesis of Ilja Roman KÃ¶hler and Elias Engelbert Plank. While the original desktop application served its purpose, it is time for a rewrite. 

## Features

Development on kopernikus is yet to start, the following features are currently planned:
 - Object browser
 - Position graphs
 - Use of [libsolaris](https://github.com/koepla/solaris)
 - Sequencer (that shows a rendered section of the sky for each object)
 - Properties
 - ASCOM support
 - Slewing curves
 
## Philosophy

Kopernikus follows the Handmade philosophy
